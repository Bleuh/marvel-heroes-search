# Marvel Super Heroes Search
This is a small demonstration of how we can use the marvel api.
I used it the do a search list.

# Features
- Search a hero by name
- See all informations of a single hero

# Needed
You need to have a marvel api key [here](https://developer.marvel.com/).

Then just copy and paste the env example (.env.example => .env) and use your own key.
